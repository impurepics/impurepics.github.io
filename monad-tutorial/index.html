            Thereâ€™s already a lot of monad tutorials on the Internet, but I wanted to try my hand.
            This tutorial is a comprehensive tutorial that is as easy to follow as possible,
            while offering a lot of practical information to be put to good use.
            There will be lots of examples but you will not learn them here.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            I think I can explain some aspects of monads better than anyone else does and probably even better than I would like. My thesis on monads is a very short one and I'm going to tell you as little as possible about my thesis. It's based on my experience. It is about this thing that you think you know. You see something you want to understand. You know what it means. You want to see it. You look for what you think it is.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            And you don't find it. You look in the wrong place. And the wrong place is where monads are hidden. You go on about monads and your understanding of monads becomes a little worse because of this.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            I think this can be the basis of a new approach to computer science. This new approach (or perhaps it will be called something else) is the one I call "functional programming".
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            As an aside, I also think functional programming is the future of software engineering. I'm not even talking about Java or Ruby or .Net. I'm talking about programming on the functional level, and not just in Java or Python.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            If you don't understand this, you won't understand computer science and software engineering.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left alert alert-primary">
            Note: all the code in this article is still pretty messy, but it was very easy to write.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            So, let's get started.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            It is a common mistake to think that everything that you can do with a monad is the same as what you can do with an ordinary function. In particular, it is a common mistake to think that functions are the same as monads. In this chapter we will see that, while some things are the same, they are not the same in the same way. So you can do things that are similar to monads, but not the same thing. So that's why this seems like something that would be really useful. But you do need to remember what monads are.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            So the reason I wanted to do this, and we talked about this before, is that monads are the simplest way that we can think about that we could think of how to solve a particular problem. And so we want to learn how to do that, but this also happens to be a really general way that we can think about how to solve a problem. And so I wanted to talk about this a little bit.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            And so, I'll give you an example. So the example that I'll give you is, the way that we can take an arbitrary function, and then transform it into some other, some other function, which is the result of applying that other function.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            So we can define a monad, if that is a good thing to do, a monad is a type class where we've defined a type that encodes this notion of this transformation. And then you can define a function which takes some function and gives you a new function, and this is a very general, general, function that can give you other functions.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            And so, if we had this function that gave you a type, and you wanted to pass it to the Monad, and then you wanted to use the Monad, you would get a new type that you would want to pass to Monad. That's a big difference.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            There are other functions that are similar to Monad. And then, there are some that are not, but they're all similar enough that if we had them, we could probably use them in many places. And then, it's just a matter of figuring out where that should go.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            And so, that's what this is about, how you want to do it, and how you want to do it in a natural way. And so, that's where we are now.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            And then, I guess the last thing is that, yeah, Monad is actually a library, and this library, this is actually the most popular one out there, and I'm not surprised that it's the most popular one, because it does a lot. But I can't, I can't, I can't do anything about it because it doesn't know me, it doesn't know what I want to do, and I can't make it change what it's doing because I'm not responsible for it, it's not in my hands, and so there's really no way of fixing that one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            So if you want to do something with Monad, you're really on your own, there's no library to give you, there's no documentation to give you, there's nothing that gives you any sort of advice, and so I'm really very sorry for that.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            Alright, I'm sorry about that, so please, just let me know.
